## TERA Toolbox
* Next generation of Tera-Proxy: Automatic updates, a graphical user interface, automated client mods, a direct connection to the game client (allowing e.g. realtime datacenter queries), and a lot more!
* Please check out [the documentation](doc/main.md) (especially if you want to develop your own modules)!
* Originally forked from https://github.com/tera-toolbox/tera-toolbox (latest patch 115).

## Installation Instructions
* Download and run the setup from [GitHub](https://github.com/tera-private-toolbox/tera-toolbox/releases/download/teratoolbox-setup/TeraToolboxSetup.exe).
* Follow the installation wizard instructions. A manual installation from GitHub is possible (install Node.JS and download this repository), but not recommended!
* Run the `TeraToolbox.exe` in the installation folder if you want to use toolbox with a graphical user interface (GUI; highly recommended!), or `TeraToolboxCLI.exe` in the installation folder for a command line interface (CLI).
* The first startup after installing TERA Toolbox may take a while, depending on your internet connection. This is because all required files will be downloaded and updated automatically.
* The most popular mods are already pre-installed for your convenience - check out the `My Mods` page. If you don't want to use a particular module, just uninstall or disable it there.
* Check out the `Get More Mods` page for mods you want to install, and the `Settings` page to configure TERA Toolbox according to your needs.
* Once you're all set, press the `Start!` button in the top right corner, then start the game as usual.
